==================================
 How it really works ?
==================================
  1. Expect a couple of MP4s that will cover in detail everything important that relates to this Website Control Unit.

  2. I will record a couple of tech clips that will explain all stuff from a very general point of view

  3. Tech clips will be recorded when [ WCU GA R2U ] will be ready !
